Usage
-----

Include jQuery and sarcasm.js in your HTML source.

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="sarcasm.js"></script>

Any element with class="sarcasm" applied to it will see its text start to scoff when the page loads. If you would prefer to apply your sarcasm dynamically, you can write something like:

    $('#mySnarkyContent').sarcasm(); //Apply ad-hoc sarcasm

Browser Support
---------------

It should work across all newer versions of Safari (5+), Chrome, Firefox (5+), IE (10+).
